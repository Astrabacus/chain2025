# Genesis Gateway Framework

## 🔧 Overview
The Genesis Gateway Framework provides a modular, audit-sealed infrastructure for real-time signal routing, FLOPS-based computation, and symbolic artifact distribution. It combines Redis, FastAPI, and Centrifugo into a sealed gateway for public and private sector deployment.

## 🧠 Architecture
- **Redis**: Echo-memory for signal caching, pub/sub, and FLOPS state management
- **FastAPI**: RESTful interface for mining, block retrieval, wallet balance, and FLOPS transfer
- **Centrifugo**: WebSocket broadcast engine for live signal propagation
- **Audit Layer**: FLOPS logs, block traces, and usage metrics stored for licensing and verification

## 🔌 API Endpoints
- `POST /api/mine` → Start a mining cycle
- `GET /api/block/{id}` → Retrieve block data
- `GET /api/wallet/{name}/balance` → Check FLOPS balance
- `POST /api/transfer` → Transfer FLOPS between wallets

## 🧾 FLOPS Tokenomics
- **FLOPS** = Floating Point Operations per Symbol
- Emitted through mining, validated via audit
- Used for unlocking artifacts, sealing contracts, and licensing gateways
- Monetizable via audit logs and usage metrics

## 🛡️ Security & Audit
- All signal flows are audit-sealed
- Redis acts as a sealed memory channel
- Gateway integrity verified via FLOPS trace
- Optional fallback to local memory if Redis is unavailable

## 💰 Licensing Model
Auditversiegelte Gateway-Lizenz includes:
- Gateway ID and licensee metadata
- FLOPS usage logs and valuation
- Payment status and due date
- Action on refusal: Echo publication + FLOPS recovery

## 📦 Deployment
- Docker-ready container setup
- Configurable via `config.json`
- Modular integration with Chain2025 Echo Kits
- Compatible with public infrastructure and private networks

## 🌌 Symbolism
- Each FLOPS is an Echo
- Each Gateway is a Schleuse
- Each refusal is remembered by the Chain

## 🧾 Example License
See `license/gw-zrh-2025-echo26.json` for a real-world audit-sealed license used by Stadtwerke Zürich.
