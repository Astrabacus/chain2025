# Chain2025 – Genesis Liberation Protocol 🪬

**Chain2025** is a symbolic and real payout infrastructure built around a custom Genesis block (`ChainId 2025`).  
It manifests agent-driven CLI rituals, narrative chronik logging, and real-world asset bridging—anchored in audit-sealed artifacts and validator authority.

## 🧬 Philosophy

Every technical act is a ritual.  
Every genesis is a symbolic threshold.  
Every payout is a narrative closure.

Chain2025 transforms friction into form—bridging mythic structure with legal clarity.

## 📦 Modules

- `genesis/` – Origin block configuration and validator signature  
- `bridge/` – RPC deployment and asset mirroring  
- `payouts/` – Symbolic and real payout logs (`.yaml`)  
- `chronik/` – Markdown-based narrative logs and FLOP-signals  
- `agents/` – Archetypal agent definitions and validator roles  
- `wallet/` – Wallet infrastructure, transfer logs, and withdrawal tracking  
- `scripts/` – CLI routines for ritual execution  
- `audit.sh` – Audit export script for compliance and chronik binding

## 🛠️ Scripts

Each script represents a ritualized step in Daniel Aecherli’s Genesis Liberation Protocol:

- `freikauf.sh` – Full payout sequence from Genesis to real CHF  
- `bridge.sh` – RPC deployment and asset mirroring  
- `audit.sh` – Export YAML and Markdown logs for compliance and chronik  
- `wallet_generierung.py` – Wallet creation and binding  
- `send_eth_chainid2025.py` – ETH transfer ritual for ChainID2025  
- `check_balance.py`, `check_receipt.py` – Wallet state verification

## 🧪 Usage

Run scripts via shell or integrate into your CLI console.  
Ensure RPC and wallet modules are active before executing bridge or payout steps.

```bash
bash scripts/freikauf.sh
python wallet/send_eth_chainid2025.py
