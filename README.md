# Chain2025 – Genesis Liberation Protocol

Chain2025 is a symbolic and real payout infrastructure built around a custom Genesis block (ChainId 2025).  
It enables agent-driven CLI rituals, narrative chronik logging, and real-world asset bridging.

## Modules

- `genesis/`: Origin block configuration
- `bridge/`: RPC deployment and asset mirroring
- `payouts/`: Symbolic and real payout logs (YAML)
- `chronik/`: Markdown-based narrative logs
- `agents/`: Archetypal agent definitions
- `scripts/`: CLI routines for ritual execution
