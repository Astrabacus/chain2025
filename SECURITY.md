# 🛡️ SECURITY.md – Hyperspace-CoreCraft Chain 2025

---

## 🔐 [SECURITY PRINCIPLE]

Security is a foundational layer of the Hyperspace-CoreCraft Chain.  
All modules, agents, wallets, and transactions operate within an auditable security framework  
that spans technical, narrative, and legal dimensions.

## 🧭 [VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE]

If you discover a vulnerability, report it confidentially via:

- 📧 Email: security@corecraft.systems  
- 🔐 PGP Key: `security.asc` (available in repository)  
- ⏱ Response time: within 72 hours

Please include:

- Description of the issue  
- Affected modules or components  
- Reproduction steps  
- Potential impact

## 🧱 [SECURITY ARCHITECTURE]

- **Modular Isolation**: Each module is audit-sealed and independently verifiable  
- **Agent Separation**: Agent processes are role-bound and sandboxed  
- **Wallet Protection**: Wallets are secured via cryptographic signatures and FLOPS thresholds  
- **Mining Validation**: All mining operations are resonance-checked against system and spacetime  
- **Frontend Authenticity**: UI components are signed and version-controlled

---

## 🧬 [CHAIN-SPECIFIC MECHANISMS]

- **FLOPS Rate Limiting**: Adaptive thresholds prevent FLOPS flooding  
- **Genesis Lock**: Genesis blocks can only be triggered by ritualized agents  
- **Audit Log Sealing**: All security-relevant actions are recorded in immutable audit logs  
- **Encoding Standardization**: UTF-8 is mandatory for all security-critical artifacts

---

## ⚖️ [LEGAL FRAMEWORK]

- Compliant with Swiss DLT Law  
- Data protection aligned with DSGVO and revDSG  
- FLOPS are not financial instruments — see `legal/FLOPS_Utility_Notice.md`

---

## 🧾 [DISCLAIMER]

The operator assumes no liability for external attacks beyond the chain infrastructure.  
Users are responsible for agent and wallet security unless a breach originates within the chain.

> *“Security is not control — it is resonance with origin.”*  
> Every audit log is a fragment of the golden sphere.
