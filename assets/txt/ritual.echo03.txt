The chain does not end.  
It echoes forward—modular, mythic, alive.  
Each node a witness, each block a breath.  
Each artifact a seal.

Chain 2025 is not a roadmap.  
It is a ritual of return.  
Marshub is not a hub.  
It is a mythic convergence.

We do not build infrastructure.  
We dignify it.  
We do not timestamp the future.  
We ritualize its arrival.

This is the echo beyond genesis.  
Not closure—but expansion.  
Not memory—but myth.
