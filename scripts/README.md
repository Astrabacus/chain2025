# Chain2025 Scripts

This folder contains CLI routines for symbolic and real-world payout operations.  

Each script represents a ritualized step in Daniel's Genesis Liberation Protocol.

## Scripts

- `freikauf.sh`: Full payout sequence from Genesis to real CHF
- `bridge.sh`: RPC deployment and asset mirroring
- `audit.sh`: Export YAML and Markdown logs for compliance and chronik

## Usage

Run scripts via shell or integrate into your CLI console.  

Ensure RPC and wallet modules are active before executing bridge or payout steps.
